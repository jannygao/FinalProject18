# 1010! Another version of Tetris

1010! Is a simplistic puzzle game similar to tetris. Combine blocks to form full vertical and horizontal lines. When a full line is formed, the line will clear. There is no time and blocks can be placed anywhere on the grid but they cannot be reoriented. If the next random block chosen cannot fit in the grid, the grid will clear and a new game will start.
